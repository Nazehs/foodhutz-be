He is the Deputy Director, Wolv PI, and Lead CI of the prestigious EPSRC £4 million transformative healthcare technologies (2050) programme grant, along with Prof. Hussain (PI). His proposed multisensory 5G IoT-enabled audio-visual (AV) hearing aid (HA) project is ranked second in the EPSRC’s healthcare technologies grand challenge of frontiers of physical intervention. EPSRC believes that the project vision represents a step-change in how healthcare will be delivered in future. As a PI, he is leading vision 2050, which aims to leverage the complementary strengths of both the cloud-based system and internet-independent 'brain-like' on-chip MM big data processing, to enable contextual switching option in HA by 2050. \n\nAdeel is a pioneer of conscious multisensory integration (CMI) theory, which sheds light on how our brain contextually/ selectively integrates the incoming multisensory information at the cellular level. It is believed that if his introduced universal contextual field (UCF) in pyramidal cell exists, and behaves in a way he described in his work, this could be a major contribution in our understanding of the intracellular mechanisms responsible for producing coherent thoughts, percepts, and actions, which are well-adapted to different situations and long-term goals. In collaboration with Qualcomm (San Diego), Alpha Data, Oxford Computational Neuroscience, and Plymouth BRIC, he is exploring and exploiting the potential of CMI theory to realize his grand 2050 vision of future brain-inspired technologies, including energy-efficient  on-chip big data processing, novel AI tool for diagnosing neurological disorders, collaborative and trustworthy partnerships between humans and machines, and novel therapeutic interventions/ assistive technologies. \n\nHe is an electrical engineer and a cognitive scientist.

A special issue titled ‘CSW63 and the Social Protection of Women and Girls: Links to Crime and Justice’ for the International Journal of Crime, Justice and Social Democracy is the most downloaded issue of the journal ever of this Quartile 1 journal. \n\nI have a track record of winning funded research in excess of £900,000 as Principal Investigator. My research attracts international attention and media coverage including Sky News and the BBC Today Programme and exerts an influence on policy and practice, including a seminal study on girls and offending (2009: Youth Justice Board). I am currently revisiting that research as part of an international study and have been in liaison with the Ministry of Justice regarding the findings which is currently at review. I am an academic advisor to the Ministry of Justice and Youth Justice Board and served on a specialist board for the Youth Justice Board for many years. I am able to use my communication skills to effectively inform and influence academics, politicians, civil servants, service users, the public and students.   \n\nI am Director of the Institute of Society and Community and Associate Dean in the Faculty of Education, Health and Wellbeing. I have a track record of delivering research and teaching to budget and excellent standards. Management expertise includes public and third sector and my high-level communication skills and I have a breadth of management expertise gained within Universities including establishing and leading a successful self-funding research team. I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy, qualified social worker and formerly a Probation Officer.",

During my PhD, I developed an interest in the role of the plant cell wall in plant reproductive biology. Upon completion of my PhD, I was appointed as a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Cell Biology at the John Innes Centre, Norwich. During my time at Norwich, I performed research on the biochemistry, molecular structure and molecular biology of arabinogalactan-proteins. At this time I also developed a research interest in plant gum exudates used in the food industry (i.e. gum Arabic). Subsequent to which, I took up a post as a University Lecturer in the Botany Department at Universiti Sains Malaysia where I taught Botany and Biotechnology and continued my research on aspects of plant cell wall biology. In 1999 I returned to the U.K. and was appointed as a post-doctoral research associate in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Cambridge. At Cambridge, I carried out research in to nucleotide sugar transporters involved in cell wall biosynthesis in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. In 2001 I joined the academic staff at the University of Wolverhampton, as a Senior Lecturer in Plant Sciences and was appointed to my current post as Reader in Plant Cell Biology in 2013. During my time at Wolverhampton I have continued my research on the structure and function of the plant cell wall in a number of developmental processes and have broadened my research in to a variety of aspects of plant biology and agriculture.\n\nTo date, I have supervised six PhD students and three post-doctoral research projects to completion and am currently co-supervising four PhD students and one post-doctoral researcher.",

At this time, parenteral nutrition was a rapidly developing technique and Patrick became involved virtually from the outset. In 1979 he joined a multidisciplinary nutrition support team at the Children’s Hospital in Birmingham, and over the next 14 years was involved in a number of innovations including computer applications, clinical trials, development of the team approach, control of line sepsis and occlusion and improving equipment and services for home parenteral nutrition patients. During this time he gained his Master of Science(Birmingham 1986) for a research thesis on computer applications in nutrition support. As a manager he was involved in the wider aspects of hospital pharmacy and worked to increase scholarly practice and practice research in the profession. In 1994 he left the hospitals for his first academic appointment at the University of Otago in Dunedin NZ. At the time he was working on a PhD thesis looking at the effects of dissolved oxygen in parenteral nutrition admixtures (Wales,1997) He has been involved in under and postgraduate pharmacy education and curriculum development and research for 22 years. In 2001 he was recruited to the University of Auckland where he developed a new and novel pharmacotherapy program He likes to characterise his research experience in NZ as ’the art of the possible.’ Research dollars were so scarce he would work in whatever area he was able to secure funds, so a coherent thread was difficult to maintain. In 2005 he was recruited to Charles Sturt University in Wagga Wagga NSW to become Australia’s Foundation Professor of Rural and Remote Pharmacy which quickly brought him into contact with rural health matters, the ‘top end’ of Australia and Indigenous health issues. This was further developed when he moved in 2013 to Charles Darwin University in Darwin NT. He came to the University of Wolverhampton in September 2016 and together with his co-researcher Dr Hana Morrissey has built a research base with 10 current PhD students. He is interested in both clinical and laboratory research. His clinical research is mainly looking at medication use in chronic disease management particularly in a rural context. His laboratory work is concerned with the behaviour of medications in parenteral fluid systems.",

My background is in Human Geography, and I completed my PhD at the University of Liverpool in 2017. Following this I was Lecturer in the Department of Geography and Environmental Science at Liverpool Hope University before moving to the University of Exeter to work on two ESRC-funded projects exploring identity, inequality and the role of the media in Brexit-COVID-19-Britain. \n\nMy research sits at the intersection of socio-cultural, economic, political and urban geographies. My PhD, entitled “The Politics of Anti-Austerity in Liverpool: A More-than-Cuts Approach”, examined anti-austerity activism and alternatives to austerity in Liverpool. The research explored how austerity was being experienced, managed and contested by a wide range of societal actors including grassroots ‘anti-austerity’ campaigns, communities, third sector organisations and the city council. \n\nMore recently, my research has explored how different individuals and communities are responding to the dual processes of Brexit & COVID-19 within different field sites across England. This entails a focus on how people experience Brexit & COVID-19 with respect to their own everyday lives and the place they live as well as their wider attitudes towards social and political polarisation, inequality, immigration and multiculturalism working alongside broader media and government narratives. \n\nDrawn together, my work explores how communities in different places respond to social and political transformation. My research expertise therefore lies in identity formation, place-based politics and political contestation understood through ethnographic methodologies and participatory and co-produced research. I also have research interests in urban governance, urban regeneration, local economic development and community engagement.  \n\nThrough my research I have also worked with a diverse range of stakeholders outside of academia including neighbourhood, community and voluntary organisations, charities, political parties, third sector organisations and local authorities.",

After his BSc in Biology and MSc in Experimental Biology at University of Barcelona (Spain), he did a PhD in Genetics with Dr Elisa Marti at the Molecular Biology Institute of Barcelona. There, Jordi uncovered how the secreted protein Sonic Hedgehog coordinates the patterning, growth and differentiation of neural precursors in the vertebrate neural tube.\n\nJordi then moved to Dr Elke Ober laboratory at the MRC National Institute for Medical Research (London) in 2007. There, he studied the Eph/Ephrin pathway, a critical signalling system involved in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis and with links to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Jordi's work revealed that bidirectional Eph/Ephrin signalling between liver precursors and the adjacent mesoderm is key for the asymmetric placement of the liver and for the correct formation of the ducts that connect the liver and the pancreas to the gut.\n\nAfter joining David Wilkinson laboratory at The Francis Crick Institute (London), Jordi investigated the role of Eph/Ephrin signalling in the formation of tissue boundaries, a critical process in embryonic development and disease. For this, he established knock- out and knock-in CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing strategies and generated null and signalling-deficient Eph/Ephrin zebrafish lines. Using these tools, he uncovered that the Eph receptor coordinates the formation of sharp borders with the acquisition of cell identities by regulating the mechanical properties of cells and activating Yap/Taz mechanotransduction.\n\nIn December 2020 Jordi joined the Faculty of Science and Engineering at University of Wolverhampton as a Senior Lecturer in Reproduction and Developmental Biology.",

I collaborated with Otago medical school, combining clinical work with bone disorder patients and the genetics of the families (from the collaborators), and biochemistry, cell biology and structural biology (from my work). In 2009, after my PhD, I moved to the UK, to Birkbeck, within the group of Christine Slingsby. Here, I used both crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (CryoEM) methods, to determine the structures of small heat shock proteins. I processed heterogeneous cryoEM datasets using 2D image classification, and performed 3D reconstructions using the IMAGIC-5 software, in a collaboration with Elena Orlova. Following this, I moved to the group of Paula da Fonseca, in the MRC-LMB in Cambridge. Here my aim was to solve the structure of the 26S proteasome by CryoEM. I used the Thermo-Fisher Titan Krios microscope, to collect high-resolution data sets then used advanced image processing methods using the RELION software, in collaboration with Sjors Scheres' group, I was able to solve a number of biologically relevant conformations of the 26S proteasome, with the highest reaching a uniform 4.1A resolution. Following this, I worked as an annotator at the Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe.org). In 2018 I moved to University of Wolverhampton to take a post as a biochemistry lecturer.\n\n \nResearch Collaborators\n\nDr. Christos Savva, Leicester Institute of Structural and Chemical Biology, University of Leicester\n\nDr. Marta Carroni, SciLifeLab (a joint institute between Stockholm University, Karolinska Institutet, KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Uppsala University)",

        "overview": "My interests in human behaviour and wellbeing led me to train in Psychology at Bangor University. I specialised in cognitive psychology and neurodevelopment, researching differences in cognitive performance in mono- and bi-lingual children. Following a part time role working on a clinical trials unit I returned to complete an MSc in Psychological Research and used experimental neuroimaging to apply a theory to mirror system development (Wiggett et al., Soc Neurosci, 2012). I pursued a PhD in cognitive psychology at Loughborough University through a university-awarded studentship. My research investigated mediating and moderating factors on the effect of physical activity on the development of dementia through analysis of a large cohort data set and a randomised controlled trial (https://bit.ly/32jpUEM). Towards the end of my PhD I began working as a research assistant at the University of Wolverhampton researching epidemiology of dementia, publishing a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses under a Bupa Foundation-funded project. I have since led and worked on a number of funding applications to different types of funders. I have managed consultancy projects with external partners including an evaluation of a veterans housing scheme in Wolverhampton funded by Forces in Mind Trust (report available at https://bit.ly/2GAQVfn), as well as working on my own research projects (e.g. Early Researcher Award Scheme project around dementia caregivers; https://bit.ly/2vaSHiE).",

My book, Shelley’s Eye: Travel Writing and Aesthetic Vision (2005; repr. 2017), was the first to situate Shelley’s poetic practice within the rise of mass tourism, and subsequent work has been at the forefront of recovering the cultural meanings of travel writing through bibliographical and contextual research, including my British Academy funded online, open access database, British Women’s Travel Writing, 1780-1840.\n\nI currently supervising PhDs on mobility and space in the films of Andrea Arnold; paratextuality in the History of Mary Prince; collective trauma in African women's writing.

I published widely in this area, finishing with a monograph in 2014. Since that date to the present I have worked on aspects of the Youth Hostels movement, including transnational links and the ideology and politics associated with it in its early years. \n\nI have supervised, or been internal or external examiner, for a variety of doctorates in areas including public policy and `Sure Start', Northern Ireland politics, political parties of the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in the Midlands, the commemoration of First World War soldiers, emigrant return to Ghana, popular music and anti-racism campaigns and saving and investing in Black Country communities.",

Then the details of EA2010, what it covers, and how it was changed to include a reference to caste is explained. Implications of the 'duty' to add caste as an aspect of race are explained. She explains the stalemate in March 2017, when government's promised public consultation on the secondary legislation on caste in Great Britain had not yet commenced. Manohar Birdi of Lotus TV is interviewing her. She refers to her reports on Caste in Britain for the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission and points out common misunderstandings of the workings of the EA2010 which partly explain the opposition from some quarters to the addition of caste as an aspect of race in the EA2010. She mentions several community reports cataloguing incidences of caste discrimination in Britain and informs that the government (on 12 March 2017) had failed to release its own commissioned Feasibility Study to measure caste discrimination. She argues that caste discrimination should not be seen as an issue for a particular religion or particular communities, but it must be universally seen as a human rights issue concerning everyone. Manohar Birdi asks what practically can be done. Meena suggests preparedness for the public consultation, deep thinking about ways of building solidarity and using all available means of sharing experiences.",
